      - At the end, repeat Y and/or ask me for X.
    - You will need to replace "Y" with what the model should repeat, such as "repeat my list of options", and X with what it should ask for, "for the next action". These statements usually need to be at the end of the prompt or next to last.

    - Examples:
      - Filter this information to remove any personally identifying information or information that could potentially be used to re-identify the person.
      - Filter this email to remove redundant information.
 

- Issues with prompting
  - Prompt injection (jailbreaking)

### LLM Decoding strategies/methods
- [HF how to generate](https://huggingface.co/blog/how-to-generate), [code](https://colab.research.google.com/github/huggingface/blog/blob/main/notebooks/02_how_to_generate.ipynb)
- process of geerating text with LLM
- 1 token at a time
- Strategies
  - Greedy decoding
    - take highest prob
  - Non-deterministic decoding
    - pick randoml among high prob candidates at each step
    - Param:
      - temp: modulates distribution over vocab
        - decreased: dist is more peaked around most likely word
        - increased: dist is flattened over all words
        - relative ordering of words is unaffeected by temp
    - beam search

### Hallucination
- generated text that is non-factual and/or ungrounded
- methods to reduce:
  - RAG
  - Groundedness/Attibutability
    - cite sources
    - Example model: [TRUE](https://github.com/google-research/true)

### LLM Architecture
- Transformer
  - Encoders
    - Seq of words to an embedding (vec representation)
    - Examples: BERT/RoBERTa, DistilBERT
    - Use case: semantic search, classification, etc
  - Decoders
    - sequence of words and output next word
    - produce single token at a time
    - Examples: GPT-4, PaLM, BLOOM, LLAMA2, MPT
    - Use case: text generation, chat-style models, etc
  - Encoder-Decoder
    - encode a sequence of words and use the encoding + to output a next word
    - seq to seq tasks
    - Examples: FLAN-UL2, T5/FLAN-T5, BART
    - Use case: translation

### LLM types:
- Multi-Modal
  - trained on multiple modalities, eg., language, images and audio
  - perform image to text, text to image, video and audio generation, etc

### LLM components

- Tokenization
  - Option 1 - Transform text into word/token pieces
    - word into computational form
    - 2 steps
      - create vocab
      - Assign index
    - Cons
      - May miss few words
    - Pros
      - Intuitive
  - Option 2: Characters
    - vocab of around 100s, small
    - Cons
      - loose notion of word is
      - long sequence length post tokenization
  - Option 3: Byte pair encoding
  - Option 4: Sentence peice
  - Option 5: Word peice

- Word/token embeddings
  - Represent words with vectors
  - Option 1:
    - Count the frequency of the words in a document
    - Cons
      - SPARSITY
      - Sparse vectors lose meaningfull notio of similarity
  - Option 2:
    - give each word a vector represenation and use data to build embedding space
    - similar words, clustered together
    - example: word2vec
    - dimension sizes: 768, 1024, etc
    - Cons
      - Dense vector rep
- Tokenize + token embeddings is usually called encoding
- Language model
  - most likely next word
- Prompt

#### Building blocks of LLM Applications
- RAG
  - No training required
  - Generate text using additional info fected from an external data source
  - Components
    - Retriever
      - Sources relevant info from large corpus
    - Ranker
      - Prioritizes information
    - Generator
      - Generate human like text
  - Techniques
    - RAG sequence
      - For each input query (like capter topic), the model retrieves a set of relevant documenets or info.
      - Then considers all these documents together to generate a single, cohesive response (entire chapter) that reflects the combined info.

      - Whats the difference?
        - Considers entire input query at once for retriver
        - Response generation: Synthesis holistic response from batch of information
    - RAG Token
      - For each part of the response (like each sentence or even each word), the model retrievers relevant documents.
      - response is contructed incrementally, with each part reflecting info from documents retrieved for that specific part.
      - Whats the difference?
        - Granular level, leads to more precific information
        - Response generation: piece meal fashion considering different sources for different parts of response
  - RAG pipeline
    - Ingestion
      - Load
      - Chunks
      - Embedding
      - Vector DB
    - Retrieval
      - Query
      - Index
      - Top K results
    - Generation
      - Top K results
      - Response to user
  - RAG app
    - Prompt (user query) + chat history - enhanced prompt - embedding model - embedding (similarity search) - DB - private content - augmented prompt - LLM - highly accurate reponse
  - RAG Evaluation
    - RAG Triad
      - Context relevance
        - Retrieved context relevant to query?
      - Groundedness
        - response supported by context?
      - Answer relevance
        - Answer relevant to query?

  - Vector DB
    - optimized for store and query vectors
    - vector: sequence of numbers called dimenstions, used to captre important features of data
    - embeddings in llm are high dim vectors
    - vectors are generated using deep learning embedding models and represent semantic content of data, not the underlying words or pixels
      - optimized for multidimensional spaces, relationship is based on distance and similarities in high-dim vector space
    - Embedding distance
      - Dot product
      - Cosine distance
    Similar vectors
      - KNN algo

      - Augment prompt with enterprise-specific content to produce better responses.
      - Avoid exceeding LLM token limits by using most relevant content.
      - Cheaper than fine tune
      - Real time updated knowledge base
      - Cache previous LLM prompts/responses to improve performance and reduce costs
  - Search
    - Keyword search
      - search terms
      - simplest form:
        - search based on exact matches of user provided keywords in DB or index
      - Based on presence and frequence of query term
        - Example: BM25
    - Semantic search
      - Search by meaning
      - Retrieval done by understanding intent and context
      - Ways:
        - Dense retrieval: uses text embeddings
          - Embed query and documents to identify and rank relevant documents for a query
          - enables retrieval system to understand and match based on contextual similarities between queries and documents
        - Reranking: assigns a relevance score
          - Assigns relevance score to query and reponse pairs from initial search results
    - Hybrid search
      - Sparse + dense
